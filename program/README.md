P2P Chat App
============
Overview and Usage
------------------
This is a python program for [peer-to-peer][1] chat application, built as a class project for Computer Networks. It can communicate between peers without the need for a central server. The only requirement is to know the peer's network address in the form of IP and Port number.

It requires the python programming language: Python 2.7 (http://python.org/download/)

The program can be run by: `python chatApp.py`

You may get a 'command not found' error in Windows, which means python is not in your PATH. Check out how to add python to your path here: http://superuser.com/questions/143119/how-to-add-python-to-the-windows-path.
